Created by [@ZackShapiro](http://twitter.com/zackshapiro)

To use the archiver:
- Download the .rb file, or do `git clone git@github.com:zackshapiro/svbtle-archive-tool.git`
- Navigate to the cloned directory in your Terminal
- Enter your blog's name in the code.
- Run `ruby svbtle_archiver.rb`
- The archive file will be created in the same directory as you save the archive file.

TODO: 
- A web interface

*Note: this may be broken with Dustin's recent changes to the Svbtle blog layout. May need repairing.*
